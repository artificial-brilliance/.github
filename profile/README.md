# Artificial Brilliance

Artificial Brilliance is a place to explore the possibilities of artificial intelligence.

I, Dominic Kramer, created this organization with the goal of sharing what I have learned with others as well as learn from others.

See my accompanying blog at [dominickramer.com](https://www.dominickramer.com) for blog posts describing the code in this organization in detail, as well as my [Github page](https://github.com/DominicKramer) for more information on other things I am working on.

This organizationâ€™s code is designed to be illustrative in nature rather than being being production ready, to help learn and illustrate topics. As such, some common practices might not be followed if doing so makes the code easier to follow and learn from.

The goal is for this organization to be helpful to anyone and everyone interested in artificial intelligence.

For any questions, comments, or feedback feel free to reach out to DominicKramer@gmail.com.
